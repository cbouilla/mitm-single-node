/*
 * PCS's producer: one machine of vlen lanes that walks trails and resolves collisions on the same lanes.
 * One vmixf per cycle advances every lane; a lane runs one instruction to its end -- a fresh trail to its
 * distinguished point, or the resolution of one candidate its dict thread queued -- and takes the next
 * one where it ends that one, a pending collision before a fresh trail.  Nothing is ever preempted and no
 * lane is ever idle, so every cycle is vlen evaluations and the machine counts nothing.
 *
 * Why one machine: a round spends a fair share of its evaluations locating collisions, and a resolver
 * that borrows the lanes in batches leaves a third of them idle (only the march moves both chains) and
 * steps its last candidates at full width.  Here a lane a collision does not need walks a trail instead.
 * A collision holds ONE lane for its whole life: its march alternates the two chains on it, which costs
 * exactly what two lanes would and leaves nothing to allocate or wait for.

/*
 * A walker's lanes and what each is doing.  A trail walks from its start to a distinguished point.  A
 * collision walks its two chains through, on one lane:
 *
 *   MEASURE0/1  a length saturated on the wire or in the shard: re-walk that chain to its endpoint to learn it
 *   ALIGN       rewind both chains and step the longer one until both are the same distance from the endpoint
 *   MARCH       step both, chain 0 on the even cycles and chain 1 on the odd ones, and compare the images
 *               until they meet or the shorter trail runs out
 *
 * Every lane always runs one of them: where an instruction ends, dispatch() starts the next on the spot,
 * so no lane is ever free, a cycle is always vlen evaluations, and there is nothing to scan and no live
 * count to keep.  The round ends by running the machine dry instead of asking it what it holds.
 *
 * dispatch() and the begin_* chain below call one another in tail position only, so a candidate that dies
 * where it starts hands the lane straight back to dispatch() -- which is why none of them answers anything
 * and no caller loops.  Each turn of that circle spends one pending candidate, so it closes.
