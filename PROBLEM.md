# Routing is the bottleneck on a large node

Measured on `grdix-4` (2 sockets, 256 cores / 512 PUs, 2 NUMA nodes of 256 PUs each,
1 TB) in September 2026, on `double_speck64_demo`.  The L3 layout below is inferred
from the placement the banner reports, not from `lstopo`; check it before relying on
it.  Everything below is from
`--n 40 --ram 4G`, so `w = 5.0e8` slots (`2^28.90`) and the auto-tuned trail length is
`1/theta == 18.76`.

**The engine delivers about 4 M distinguished points per second to its dictionary, on
a machine whose walkers can produce 760 M/s.  Nothing tried so far moved that number,
because every point on a node passes through one thread.**

Re-measured since on a second, smaller machine, where the same 4 M/s ceiling appeared and
**one MPI rank per L3 domain moved it by 11x** (40x on collisions per second): **§8**.
Read that section before quoting any number here.

## 1. What was measured

`-O3 -DNDEBUG` throughout; the first `-O0` run is left out, its rates mean nothing.
"offered" is `walkers * (f/s) / L`; "absorbed" is `inserters * (probe/s)`, both as the
round report prints them.

| walkers / inserters | threads | offered | walker-queue drops | absorbed | dict occupancy | collisions | coll/s |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 507 / 4 | 512 | 757 M/s | 95.9% | 3.9 M/s | 3.1% | 2^16.19 | 13.8 K |
| 250 / 4 | 255 | 456 M/s | 92.4% | 4.4 M/s | 7.3% | 2^17.88 | 27.0 K |
| 24 / 32 | 57 | 48 M/s | 90.4% | 4.6 M/s | 76.7% | 2^24.17 | 219 K |
| 4 / 4 | 9 | 2.8 M/s | 0.88% | 2.8 M/s | 8x overfilled | 2^29.33 | **477 K** |

Two readings that are easy to get wrong:

- **Wall-clock per round is not the metric.**  A round closes on distinguished points
  *found* (`controller.hpp:96`, against `N_DP`), and in the first three rows over 90%
  of those were dropped before reaching a shard.  The 512-thread run finished a round
  in 5.4 s having inserted 3% of `beta*w`; the 9-thread run took 1436 s and filled the
  dictionary eight times over.  Collisions per second is the objective, and on it the
  9-thread configuration beats the 512-thread one by **34x**.
- **The comm thread's apparent 31-34 M DP/s in rows 1 and 2 was 87% *failed* pushes** --
  a `head.load` and a return, no write -- because the inserter queues were permanently
  full.  Its real delivery has been 2.8-4.6 M DP/s in every configuration ever run.

## 2. Why this is the whole game

```
rounds        = 1.8 * 2^n / w
DPs per round = beta * w
total DPs     = 1.8 * beta * 2^n          <- independent of w, theta, alpha
runtime       = 1.8 * beta * 2^n / D_total
```

The number of distinguished points the whole job must route is fixed by `n` alone.
**Routing throughput is the attack's speed, one for one.**  At `--n 40` that is
`1.58e13` points: 41 days at 4.5 M/s, 5.8 hours at the 760 M/s the walkers already
produce.

Three consequences:

- **Difficulty cannot buy anything.**  `total f-evals = 1.8 * beta * 2^n * L` with
  `L = sqrt(2^n / w) / alpha`, so lowering `theta` cuts the DP rate and raises the
  f-work by the same factor.  `runtime * DP rate` is a constant.
- **Memory makes it worse.**  DP work is flat in `w`; f-work falls as `1/sqrt(w)`.  A
  node with 1 TB and 256 cores is by construction one whose walkers are nearly free
  and whose router is everything.  Using the full 1 TB instead of 4 GB multiplies the
  DP rate by `sqrt(250) = 16`.
- **Scale makes it worse too.**  `w = ram_per_node * N / 8`, so
  `D_node = R_f * alpha * sqrt(w / 2^n)` grows as `sqrt(N)`.  The funnel tightens as
  the machine gets bigger, in both directions at once.

Where one comm thread at `C = 4.5 M DP/s` is enough, with `alpha = 2.5` and
`R_f = 1.4e10 f/s` per node (507 walkers x 28 M, SMT on, dictionary still empty), from
`w <= 2^n * (C / (alpha * R_f))^2`:

| RAM/node | dictionary usable from | nodes before the router saturates, at n = 64 |
|---|---|---|
| 4 GB | n >= 55 | ~600 |
| 1 TB | n >= 63 | **~2** |

That last cell is the finding.  With the memory this machine actually has, the
one-comm-thread design runs out at about two nodes.

## 3. Where the comm thread's time goes

`route_walker_queues` (`engine.hpp:82`) sweeps every walker queue with `pop_bulk(64)`,
then `deliver_local` (`engine.hpp:74`) writes each 24-byte point into the ring of the
shard that owns it.  Measured cost per *delivered* point, 32 inserters: **220 ns**.

- **Distance.**  One thread pulls from up to 507 queues spread over ~16 L3 domains and
  both sockets, then scatters into rings whose consumers are equally spread.  Nearly
  every line it touches arrives from another die.
- **True sharing on the ring data.**  With 32 inserters the queues are never full
  (`DROP_INSERTERQ == 0`), so the consumer sits right behind each write; 24-byte points
  put 2-3 of them per 64-byte line, and half the consumers are across the socket.
- **One `tail.store(release)` per point** (`spsc.hpp:44`), which each idle inserter
  re-reads from its `in.empty()` spin.  `SPSCQueue` has `pop_bulk` and no `push_bulk`;
  that asymmetry is the bug.
- **Two runtime 64-bit divisions per point** in `deliver_local` -- `x % n_nodes` and
  `x / n_nodes % inserters_per_node` -- with `n_nodes == 1`, because both are runtime
  members.  The inserter adds three more (`inserter.hpp:53`, `:54`, `:101`).

All but the last scale *with* the inserter count, which is why 4 -> 32 inserters made
the comm thread 7.5x slower instead of faster.

Two smaller effects, for completeness.  Thread placement (`parameters.hpp:143`) is
NUMA-aware and SMT-blind: it takes the next free CPU of a NUMA node, so once it passes
that node's primary threads it hands walkers the siblings of the comm thread and of
every inserter.  Measured by leaving the siblings idle (`--walkers-per-node 250`):
worth ~10% on those threads, while SMT is worth +66% to the walkers -- so the fix is
SMT-aware placement, not fewer threads.  And an inserter probe was believed to cost
~900 ns against a 1 GB shard, against ~150 ns for one dependent random access with a page
walk, which made huge pages and software pipelining (the TODO at `inserter.hpp:82`) look
worth trying.  **That figure was wrong**: measured on its own, a probe costs **58 ns** and
a shard retires 17.2 M/s (§8.1).  The ~900 ns was the pipeline around the probe, not the
probe.

## 4. What is not the answer

- **More inserters.**  Two targets, both unreachable.  Matching what the walkers
  produce needs `I/W = alpha * (R_f/R_p) * sqrt(w / 2^n) = 1.66` -- more inserters than
  walkers, 158 of the 254 workers.  Matching only what the comm thread delivers needs
  `31M / 1.1M = 28`.  Going from 4 to 32 made things worse, per section 3: the balance
  is right, the queue implementation punishes it.
- **Fewer walkers.**  The 9-thread run wins only because it stops overwhelming the
  router.  It is a diagnosis, not a configuration to ship.
- **Walkers delivering into the shards themselves** (MPSC, bypassing the comm thread).
  That removes the `1/N` local fraction and leaves `(N-1)/N` exactly where it was.  A
  single-node trick, worthless at scale, not worth a protocol change.
- **Turning `alpha` down.**  Section 2: it trades one for one.

## 5. Ideas worth trying

### A. One MPI rank per L3 domain -- zero code

`R` ranks per node is `R` comm threads, and the routing work splits `R` ways; whether
a point's shard is on this node stops mattering.  Binding a rank to an L3 domain makes
its walkers, its staging buffers and its shards all domain-local, so the per-router
rate should rise as well as the count.

```bash
mpirun -np 16 --map-by l3cache --bind-to l3cache \
    build/examples/double_speck64_demo --n 40 --ram 250M \
    --inserters-per-node 4 --walkers-per-node 8
```

`--ram 250M x 16` keeps `w` at the same 4 GB total, so the insertion rate is directly
comparable.  Check the banner reports 32 CPUs in the affinity mask, not 512: nothing
coordinates placement across ranks, so ranks that inherit the same mask will silently
pin to the same CPUs.

Cost: send buffers grow as `O(ranks^2)` (16 ranks x 1000 nodes is 1.15 GB per rank),
a round barrier over `16N` ranks instead of `N`, and `16N` progress reports converging
on rank 0.  Fine to ~10-20k ranks.  This contradicts the "one MPI rank per node"
convention in `CLAUDE.md`, which is exactly what makes it interesting.

### B. Router threads, one per L3 domain -- the in-process version of A

A router owns the walker queues, the staging buffers and the inserters of its domain;
thread 0 keeps every MPI call (`THREAD_FUNNELED` is why the funnel exists) but does
**no per-point work**: it posts an `Isend` for a full buffer, and hands an arriving
buffer to the router that owns it.

Two things this has to get right:

- **The destination key must name a single consumer.**  Today `dst = x % n_nodes`
  (`engine.hpp:92`), so an arriving buffer holds points for every shard on the target
  node and someone must scan and scatter it -- `O(D)` on one thread, on the *receiving*
  side too, which is half the problem and would survive the change untouched.  Key on
  `(node, domain)` or on the global shard index instead.
- **Buffer memory sets `buffer_capacity`.**  `routers * destinations * capacity`, and
  it wants to be L3-resident: ~32 MB per router, so ~850 points per buffer at 1600
  global shards.  At 16k shards that falls to 85, too small to amortise a message, and
  the key has to become two-level (`node`, then domain within it) to keep the
  destination count at `N * R`.

Over A this buys: no shared-memory copy for intra-node traffic, one dictionary and one
round barrier per node instead of 16, and `O(R^2 N)` buffers instead of `O((16N)^2)`.
It costs a real `PROTOCOL.md` rewrite -- a `ROUTER` role in §1, new channels in §3,
the `TAG_POINTS` addressing and wire layout in §2, and a new stage in the §4.5 drain
(routers must quiesce after the walkers and before the buffers flush).

**Measure A first.**  It is the same architecture implemented by the MPI runtime, and
it bounds what B is worth before anyone spends a protocol rewrite on it.

**Measured: §8.4.  A works** -- 3.5x at one rank per socket, 11.1x at 16 ranks on a
64-PU node, where 97.7% of the points found reach a shard and the funnel disappears.
B's remaining value is the shared-memory copy and the buffer count, not the bottleneck.

### C. Constants, worth having either way

Each multiplies whatever parallel routing gives.

- `push_bulk` on `SPSCQueue`: bucket a whole sweep by destination and push each bucket
  once -- ~48 points per `tail.store` instead of one, and contiguous writes per ring.
  **Done, and worth nothing: §8.3.**  It moves where the points are lost, not how many
  arrive.
- Multiply-shift reciprocals for the five runtime divisions of section 3; all five
  divisors are fixed at construction.
- `MADV_HUGEPAGE` on the shard (which means replacing `vector<u64> A`, since its
  zero-fill is also the NUMA first touch), and the software-pipelined probe.
  **Abandon both: §8.1 measures the probe at 58 ns, 17.2 M/s per shard, and the loop
  already overlaps its misses.**

## 6. Accounting that hides all this

- **A round closes on points found, not inserted** (`controller.hpp:96`).  A starved
  run burns rounds against an almost-empty dictionary and reports them complete.  The
  round report now prints a `ROUTED` line -- points found per second, points *inserted*
  per second, the percentage that reached a shard, and the dictionary's load in
  insertions per slot -- so a starved round is visible at a glance.  The closing rule
  itself is unchanged.
- ~~**`controller.hpp:179` divides `BAD_PROBE` by `N_DP`**~~ -- **fixed**: the probe
  failure percentage is now `BAD_PROBE / N_PROBE`.  It had been reading 3.4% where the
  truth was 97%.  The other four percentages on that line are walker-side, so `ndp` is
  right for them.
- ~~There is still **no way to measure a shard probe in isolation**~~ -- **there is
  now**: `probe_benchmark()` in `benchmark.hpp`, called by `double_speck64_bench` when it
  is given a `--ram` (optional there; two lines to wire into another driver).  It builds
  `inserters_per_node` shards of the size and at the
  placement the engine would give them and hammers each with pseudo-random endpoints,
  reporting probes/s per quarter-`w` of load.  `--beta` bounds how far it fills.  It
  does not exercise the hit path, so it measures the probe, not the collision queue.

## 7. Numbers to re-measure

**Re-measured on a different node in §8**, which supersedes section 1 for anything but
`grdix-4` itself.  The original note stands:

The resolver is now batched (`PROTOCOL.md` §3.2), so walkers stay near their
empty-dictionary rate much further into a round than they did when these runs were
taken -- which means they will offer *more* points and reach the router's ceiling
sooner, not later.  Everything in section 1 should be re-run before it is quoted.

Worth having per node, once: `double_speck64_bench` (the scalar/vector ratio -- 5.9x
on a laptop), the comm thread's delivered rate at 1, 4 and 16 inserters, and a probe
microbenchmark once one exists.

## 8. Re-measured on grvingt-52, and the funnel bracketed on both sides

`grvingt-52` (Grid'5000, Nancy): 2 x Xeon Gold 6130 (Skylake-SP), 32 cores / 64 PUs, 2
NUMA nodes, **2** L3 domains of 22 MB, 192 GB -- a quarter of `grdix-4`.  `-O3 -DNDEBUG`,
September 2026, `double_speck64_demo --n 40 --ram 4G --seed 1337 --nrounds 1` throughout:
the same operating point as section 1, `w = 5.0e8` slots, auto-tuned `1/theta == 18.76`,
`beta*w == 4.0e9` points per round.  "inserted" is the `ROUTED` line of the round report
(§6), i.e. `N_PROBE`: what actually reached a shard.

### 8.1 The three legs, each measured on its own

| leg | capacity | how |
|---|---|---|
| what the walkers offer | **98 M DP/s** (61 walkers) | round report, `-I 2` |
| what one comm thread delivers | **4.2 M DP/s** | round report, `-I 8` |
| what 8 shards can absorb | **142 M probe/s** | `double_speck64_bench --ram 4G -I 8` |

One walker thread evaluates `vfg` at 79 M f/s with every PU busy (184 M/s alone --
Skylake drops its clock hard under AVX-512), and SMT is nearly free here: 79 M/s per
thread at 32 *and* at 64 processes, so the node's walkers are worth **5.0 G f/s**.

The probe benchmark (new, §6) is what changes the picture: **17.2 M probe/s per shard,
58 ns a probe, flat from an empty shard to one insertion per slot, and linear in the
shard count** -- 142 M/s at 8 shards, 277 M/s at 16, on 4 GB total either way.  Section 3
guessed ~900 ns against a 1 GB shard and was 15x pessimistic: the probes of a batch are
independent, so the hardware already keeps a dozen misses in flight.  **Huge pages and
the software-pipelined probe (§5.C, third bullet) have nothing left to win.**

The middle leg is 23x below what is offered to it and 34x below what waits behind it.

### 8.2 The inserter sweep, re-run

Walkers fill the mask (`63 - I`), so the thread count is 64 in every row:

| inserters | round | offered | inserted | coll/s | dict load |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 52.0 s | 77 M/s | 2.7 M/s | 59 K | 0.28 |
| 2 | 40.9 s | 98 M/s | 3.3 M/s | 69 K | 0.27 |
| 4 | 64.3 s | 62 M/s | 3.5 M/s | 118 K | 0.45 |
| 8 | 80.4 s | 50 M/s | 4.2 M/s | 205 K | 0.68 |
| 16 | 127.5 s | 31 M/s | 4.2 M/s | 274 K | 1.08 |
| 32 | 759.5 s | 5 M/s | 3.2 M/s | 462 K | 4.84 |

**The same 4 M DP/s ceiling as `grdix-4`, on a machine with a quarter of the cores and a
fifth of the RAM.**  A ceiling that does not move with the machine is not a fact about
the machine: it is one thread's ~250 ns per point, times one thread.

The rows still disagree about the best `I`, and for the reason section 1 gives: a round
closes on points *found*, so a starved run buys its collisions by running long enough to
overfill an almost-empty dictionary.  Read §8.4 instead.

### 8.3 `push_bulk`: implemented, and worth nothing

§5.C's first bullet is in the tree (`SPSCQueue::push_bulk`, per-shard buckets of 128 in
`CommThread`, PROTOCOL.md §3.1).  Same seed, same configuration, before -> after:

| inserters | inserted | walker-queue drops | inserter-queue drops |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | 3.26 -> 3.4 M/s | 3.04 G -> 3.41 G | 0.83 G -> 0.40 G |
| 8 | 4.24 -> 4.2 M/s | 2.58 G -> 2.29 G | 1.09 G -> 1.35 G |
| 16 | 4.24 -> 4.0 M/s | **2.30 G -> 0.098 G** | **1.16 G -> 3.19 G** |

It does exactly what it was meant to do and it buys nothing.  At 16 shards it moves the
loss wholesale from the walker queues to the inserter queues -- the comm thread now
drains 47 walker queues nearly losslessly -- and the delivered rate does not move.  **The
release store per point was never the cost.**  Kept in the tree so that nobody spends the
afternoon on it twice.

### 8.4 One rank per socket, then per 16 PUs, then per 4: idea A is the answer

Zero code.  64 PUs, 4 GB of dictionary, 4.0e9 points per round and the same `theta` in
every row; only the number of ranks -- hence of comm threads -- changes.  Every row of
this table, the `R = 1` baseline included, is the current tree (§8.3).  Launched with
`--map-by ppr:R:node:PE=(64/R) --bind-to hwthread --ram (4G/R)`, and every rank's banner
confirms a disjoint affinity mask over exactly one NUMA node.

| ranks/node | per rank | walkers | offered | **inserted** | reached | coll/s | dict load | round |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1+8+55 | 55 | 47.7 M/s | 4.2 M/s | 8.9% | 197 K | 0.71 | 83.9 s |
| 2 | 1+4+27 | 54 | 95.7 M/s | **14.8 M/s** | 15.4% | 1.05 M | 1.24 | 41.9 s |
| 4 | 1+2+13 | 52 | 102.9 M/s | **26.4 M/s** | 25.7% | 2.60 M | 2.05 | 38.9 s |
| 8 | 1+1+6 | 48 | 93.1 M/s | **38.8 M/s** | 41.7% | 4.83 M | 3.34 | 43.0 s |
| 16 | 1+1+2 | 32 | 47.9 M/s | **46.8 M/s** | **97.7%** | 7.96 M | 7.82 | 83.5 s |

**3.5x, 6.3x, 9.2x, 11.1x on the delivered rate; 5x, 13x, 25x, 40x on collisions per
second**, which is the objective.  Per comm thread that is 4.2, 7.4, 6.6, 4.8, 2.9 M DP/s
-- a router congested at its operating point is worth ~5 M DP/s, an uncongested one 8 to
12 (§8.5), and `R` of them are worth about `R` times that.  The walkers gain as well,
16.4 -> 40.5 M f/s each, because they stop pushing into a saturated queue.

The last two rows are the interesting ones.  At `R = 16` the funnel is **gone**: 97.7% of
every point found reaches a shard, the round fills the dictionary to the `beta = 8` it was
asked for, and it does so in the same 83.5 s that `R = 1` spent filling 9% of it.  `R = 16`
also gives up 23 of the 55 walkers to comm threads and still wins 40x, but it is the end
of the road on this node: offered (47.9 M/s) and inserted (46.8 M/s) have met, so the
walkers are the constraint again and a 17th rank would only take another walker away.

Intra-node traffic goes through MPI shared memory for `(R-1)/R` of the points and costs
nothing measurable: `DROP_OUT` stays below 6e5 against 4.0e9 points, at every `R`.

**This is the configuration to run today**, and it contradicts the "one MPI rank per node"
convention in `CLAUDE.md`, as section 5 warned it would.  **Idea B (router threads) is now
worth its protocol rewrite only where one rank per L3 domain is impossible**: it saves the
shared-memory copy, one dictionary and one barrier per node, and `O((RN)^2)` buffers --
none of which is the bottleneck A already removes.

### 8.5 What one comm thread can really do, and what makes it collapse

Turn the *walker count* down and leave everything else at what the auto-tuning wants, so
that the search's physics is identical in every row and only the pressure on one comm
thread changes.  One rank, 8 shards, 4 GB, `--beta 1` (a round of `w == 5.0e8` points):

| walkers | offered | inserted | reached a shard | probe/s per shard | dict load | round |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 3.6 M/s | 3.6 M/s | **99.9%** | 445 K | 1.00 | 140.2 s |
| 2 | 5.6 M/s | 5.6 M/s | **99.8%** | 703 K | 1.00 | 88.8 s |
| 4 | 7.6 M/s | 7.5 M/s | **99.7%** | 943 K | 1.00 | 66.2 s |
| 8 | 8.0 M/s | 8.0 M/s | **99.7%** | 994 K | 1.00 | 62.7 s |
| 16 | 12.6 M/s | 9.0 M/s | 71.5% | 1.1 M | 0.72 | 39.7 s |
| 32 | 40.7 M/s | 12.1 M/s | 29.8% | 1.5 M | 0.30 | 12.4 s |
| 55 | 60.6 M/s | 12.1 M/s | 19.9% | 1.5 M | 0.20 | 8.3 s |
| 55, `--beta 8` | 47.7 M/s | **4.2 M/s** | 8.9% | 528 K | 0.71 | 83.9 s |

**One comm thread is lossless to 8 M DP/s and peaks at 12 M/s.**  A single walker feeds it
3.6 M DP/s and loses one point in 700; 55 walkers feed it 60 M/s and lose four points in
five.  Nothing is gained by the flood: the round ends with a fifth of the dictionary
filled instead of all of it.

The last row is the one to stare at.  Same rank, same 55 walkers, same 8 shards, same
difficulty -- only `beta`, i.e. how full the dictionary gets before the round closes -- and
delivery falls from **12.1 to 4.2 M DP/s** while the load rises from 0.20 to 0.71.  A
fuller shard means more probes hit, and every hit is a mutex acquisition on
`shared.coll_q` plus a resolution a walker has to pay for.  **A third of what one router
can do is being spent on the collision path, at the operating point that matters.**

The same collapse seen through `--difficulty` instead, all else fixed (55 walkers, 8
shards, 4 GB, `--beta 0.25`):

| trail length | offered | inserted | reached a shard | probe/s per shard | dict load |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1375 | 292 K/s | 288 K/s | **98.6%** | 36 K | 0.25 |
| 688 | 811 K/s | 332 K/s | 40.9% | 41 K | 0.10 |
| 344 | 2.4 M/s | 541 K/s | 22.8% | 68 K | 0.06 |
| 172 | 4.9 M/s | 1.0 M/s | 21.2% | 129 K | 0.05 |
| 86 | 11.3 M/s | 2.7 M/s | 24.0% | 340 K | 0.06 |
| 43 | 24.2 M/s | **7.2 M/s** | 29.7% | 899 K | 0.07 |

One warning about this second table: `theta` is not a free knob for a measurement.  At
`alpha = 2.5` the auto-tuning wants `L == 18.76`, and by `L == 688` the trails merge so
thoroughly that **74% of probes hit** -- against 5% at the auto value -- although the
shard is a tenth full.  Those rows measure trail merging as much as routing, which is why
the walker sweep above is the one to quote.

### 8.6 Where that leaves the diagnosis

Section 1's headline survives -- routing is the bottleneck -- and it is now bracketed
rather than inferred.  What is new:

- **It is not the outbound store** (§8.3), **not the probe** (§8.1: 58 ns, and it
  pipelines itself), and **not memory bandwidth** (277 M probe/s over 16 shards, linear
  in the count).  It is one thread standing in the path of every point.
- **`R` comm threads are worth about `R` times one**, measured to 16 ranks on one node
  (§8.4), and the fix needs no code at all.  Section 2's arithmetic can be re-read with
  `C = 5 M DP/s per rank` rather than per node.
- **After that, the collision path -- not the dictionary.**  §8.5 prices it: the same 55
  walkers and 8 shards deliver 12.1 M DP/s over a round that fills a fifth of the
  dictionary and 4.2 M DP/s over one that fills 0.71 of it, **a factor of 3 lost to the
  hit path alone**.  In-engine inserters run 30x below the 17.2 M probe/s they are capable
  of, and the only structure they share is `shared.coll_q`: one mutex, every inserter
  pushing, every walker polling and popping.  The `I = 32` row of §8.2 (walkers down to
  3.8 M f/s each, 0.70*w collisions in one round) is the same effect from the other side.
  A per-inserter collision queue is the obvious next experiment, and it is cheap.
- Numbers worth having that this run did not take: the collision queue with per-inserter
  rings; `R` ranks per node at `--n 48` or above, where a round is long enough that
  startup and dictionary zeroing vanish; and idea A on a node with more than two L3
  domains, where `R` can grow without taking the last walkers away.
